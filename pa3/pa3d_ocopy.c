/* Programming Assignment 3: Exercise D
 *
 * Now that you have a working implementation of semaphores, you can
 * implement a more sophisticated synchronization scheme for the car
 * simulation. 
 *
 * Study the program below.  Car 1 begins driving over the road,  entering
 * from the East at 40 mph.  After 900 seconds,  both Car 3 and Car 4 try to
 * enter the road. Car 1 may or may not have exited by this time (it should
 * exit after 900 seconds, but recall that the times in the simulation are
 * approximate). If Car 1 has not exited and Car 4 enters, they will crash
 * (why?).  If Car 1 has exited,  Car 3 and Car 4 will be able to enter the
 * road, but since they enter from opposite directions,  they will eventually
 * crash. Finally,  after 1200 seconds, Car 2 enters the road from the West
 * and traveling twice as fast as Car 4.  If Car 3 was not coming from the
 * opposite direction, Car 2 would eventually reach Car 4 from the back and
 * crash.  You may wish to experiment with reducing the initial delay of
 * Car 2,  or increase the initial delay of Car 3, to cause Car 2 to crash
 * with Car 4 before Car 3 crashes with Car 4. 
 *
 *
 * Exercises
 *
 * 1) Modify the procedure driveRoad such that the following rules are obeyed:
 *
 *   	A) Avoid all collisions. 
 *
 * 	B) Multiple cars should be allowed on the road,  as long as they are
 *  	traveling in the same direction.  
 *
 *  	C) If a car arrives and there are already other cars traveling in the
 * 	SAME DIRECTION,  the arriving car should be allowed enter as soon as it
 * 	can. Two situations might prevent this car from entering immediately:
 *  	(1) there is a car immediately in front of it (going in the same
 *   	direction), and if it enters it will crash (which would break rule A);
 * 	(2) one or more cars have arrived at the other end to travel in the
 *  	opposite direction and are waiting for the current cars on the road
 *  	to exit, which is covered by the next rule.  
 *
 * 	D) If a car arrives and there are already other cars traveling in the
 * 	OPPOSITE DIRECTION,  the arriving car must wait until all these other
 *  	cars complete their course over the road and exit.  It should only wait
 *   	for the cars already on the road to exit; no new cars traveling in the
 * 	same direction as the existing ones should be allowed to enter. 
 *
 *  	E) The previous rule implies that if there are multiple cars at each
 *  	end waiting to enter the road, each side will take turns in allowing
 * 	one car to enter and exit. However,  if there are no cars waiting at
 * 	one end,  then as cars arrive at the other end, they should be allowed
 *  	to enter the road immediately.  
 *	
 *   	F) If the road is free (no cars), then any car attempting to enter
 * 	should not be prevented from doing so. 
 *
 *  	G) All starvation must be avoided.  For example,  any car that is
 *  	waiting must eventually be allowed to proceed.  
 *
 * This must be achieved ONLY by adding synchronization and making use of
 * shared memory (as described in Exercise C). You should NOT modify the
 * delays or speeds to solve the problem. In other words, the delays and
 * speeds are givens,  and your goal is to enforce the above rules by making
 * use of only semaphores and shared memory.  
 *
 * 2) Devise different tests (using different numbers of cars,  speeds
 * directions) to see whether your improved implementation of driveRoad
 * obeys the rules above. 
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
 * 
 * 1) Avoid busy waiting.  In class one of the reasons given for using
 * semaphores was to avoid busy waiting in user code and limit it to
 * minimal use in certain parts of the kernel.  This is because busy
 * waiting uses up CPU time, but a blocked process does not. You have
 * semaphores available to implement the driveRoad function, so you
 * should not use busy waiting anywhere. 
 *
 * 2) Prevent race conditions.  One reason for using semaphores is to
 * enforce mutual exclusion on critical sections to avoid race conditions. 
 * You will be using shared memory in your driveRoad implementation.  
 * Identify the places in your code where there may be race conditions
 * (the result of a computation on shared memory depends on the order
 * that processes execute).  Prevent these race conditions from occurring
 * by using semaphores. 
 *
 * 3) Implement semaphores fully and robustly. It is possible for your
 * driveRoad function to work with an incorrect implementation of
 * semaphores,  because controlling cars does not exercise every use of
 * semaphores.  You will be penalized if your semaphores are not correctly
 * implemented, even if your driveRoad works. 
 *
 * 4) Control cars with semaphores: Semaphores should be the basic
 * mechanism for enforcing the rules on driving cars.  You should not
 * force cars to delay in other ways inside driveRoad such as by calling
 * the Delay function or changing the speed of a car.  (You can leave in
 * the delay that is already there that represents the car's speed,  just
 * don't add any additional delaying). Also,  you should not be making
 * decisions on what cars do using calculations based on car speed (since
 * there are a number of unpredictable factors that can affect the
 * actual cars' progress). 
 *
 * GRADING INFORMATION
 *
 * 1) Semaphores: We will run a number of programs that test your
 * semaphores directly (without using cars at all).  For example:
 * enforcing mututal exclusion, testing robustness of your list of
 * waiting processes, calling signal and wait many times to make sure
 * the semaphore state is consistent,  etc. 
 *
 * 2) Cars: We will run some tests of cars arriving in different ways
 * to make sure that you correctly enforce all the rules for cars given
 * in the assignment.  We will use a correct semaphore implementation for
 * these tests so that even if your semaphores are not correct you could
 * still get full credit on the driving part of the grade (you may assume
 * that in our implementation, semaphore unblocking is FIFO,  i.e.,  for
 * each semaphore, the order in which processes are unblocked is the
 * same order in which those same processes blocked).  Think about
 * how your driveRoad might handle different situations and write your
 * own tests with cars arriving in different ways to make sure you handle
 * all cases correctly. 
 *
 *
 * WHAT TO TURN IN
 *
 * You must turn in two files: mycode3.c and pa3d.c. mycode3.c should
 * contain you implementation of semaphores, and pa3d.c should contain
 * your modified version of InitRoad and driveRoad (Main will be ignored).  
 * Note that you may set up your static shared memory struct and other
 * functions as you wish. They should be accessed via InitRoad and driveRoad
 * as those are the functions that we will call to test your code.  
 *
 * Your programs will be tested with various Main programs that will exercise
 * your semaphore implementation,  AND different numbers of cars, directions
 * and speeds,  to exercise your driveRoad function.  Our Main programs will
 * first call InitRoad before calling driveRoad. Make sure you do as much
 * rigorous testing yourself to be sure your implementations are robust. 
 * Good luck.
